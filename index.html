                <p> <h4>I'm an IT professional working as role of Software Developer for almost 4 years. My major area of work is Robotics Process Automation which mainly involves developing software robots to mimic human behaviour for very predictive and rule based processes. The main motive of this role is to get people off the very mundane and repetitive work and involve them in more value adding activities. To accomplish this task I'm using tools like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Pega Robotics etc.</p>
                    
                    <p>As we all know in order to grow professionally and personally in one's life we need to engage ourselves in constant learning programmes. In order to fulfil that i took an M.tech work intergrated course with BITS Pilani, one of the most prestigeous institutes. I have learned so many things so far some relating to my work doamin and some outside my domain. I'm sure this learning is going to help me in a very positive manner going forward in my career.</p>
                    
                    <p> Apart from my professional goals i intend to bring a positive change in my surroundings, be it by educating peopleon the importance of education, planting trees or maybe by developing something of my own in order to contribute to the better surroundings.</p>
